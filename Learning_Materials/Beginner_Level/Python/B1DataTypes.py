# Hello! this is the data types file. Here we will learn about the data types in python.

# Data types are the types of data that we can store in a variable. Python contains many data types. Some of them are:
# 1. int (any whole number)
a_number = 1
# 2. float (any decimal number)
a_decimal = -0.57382
# 3. str (any string)
a_string = "Hello World!"
# 4. char (any single character)
a_character = "a"
# 5. bool (A True or False)
a_boolean = True
the_other_boolean = False
# and many more! However for now we will focus only on these

# By now, you should notice that each of the data types follow a pattern. They
# have a name, equals sign, then a value. This forms what I like to call the
# "variable equation".
#   variable_name = value

# (something to note is that in python, you can just assign a variable a value
# without declaring the data type. This will be different in java.)

# Now, let's try printing out the values of these variables. To do this, we
# will use the pre-made method print(). This method will print out whatever
# is inside the parentheses. For example:

# we can print a value
print("Hello world! is 2+2 = 4?")
# we can also print a variable
print(a_boolean)

# You can also create a variable with no value, and assign it a value later.
a_num = None
a_num = 5
print(a_num)

# Now, if you want a bit of practice, try creating some of your own variables
# and printing them out. You may also consider writing a reference sheet for
# for those variables if you think you might forget them.
