    // This next section is going to go over what 'operators' are, and what they do!
    // There are various operators, but the 4 main types are
    // - Arithmetic: adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc.
    // - Assignment: assigning a value to a variable
    // - Comparison: comparing two values
    // - Logical: if this AND this, then that, (hope that made sense, basically it's
    // just "AND" or "OR")

    // Examples

    // Arithmetic
    int x = 5 + 10; // the "+" is an example of an arithmatic operator

    // Assignment
    int y = 5; // the "=" is an example of an assignment operator

    // the next part contains if statements, which we will go over in the next
    // section
    // so for now just focus on the operators

    // Comparison
    if (x == y) { // the "==" is an example of a comparison operator
      System.out.println("x is equal to y!");
    }

    // Logical
    if (x == 5 && y == 5) { // the "&&" is an example of a logical operator
      System.out.println("x and y are both equal to 5!");
    }
  }
}
