    // Hey! congrats on making it to the check in, hope the previous stuff wasn't too hard :)
    // A small note, if you have any questions, or aren't completely sure how something works, now
    // is a good time to ask! As we will be building on these concepts, and it is no fun to just
    // get stuck super far ahead and have no idea what is going on.

    // anyways, here are some questions

    // 1. How do you convert a string to an integer?
    // 2. How can you use a loop in a for loop?
    // 3. How can a while loop (or for loop) get stuck in an infinite loop?

    // A fun exercise you can do
      // Create a program that takes a word from the user, and it's definition, and stores it in a dictionary array
      // Include an array, loop, and function
  }
}
