## Contributing

This is free for **anyone** to contribute to! (Especailly if you are part of our team)  
If you would like to contribute to this repository; ‚ú®amazing!‚ú® Just follow some rules:

**Wiki**
- Before you edit anything in the wiki, prepose your change in the [discussion](https://github.com/J-The-Fox/FRC-Team-5098/discussions/3) first
- If you take images, text, screenshots, etc from somewhere else for the wiki, give credit to the original source or author!
- Spruce up the wiki if you like, add pictures and different headers. But try to stick to a similar theme throughout

**Code**
- If you're adding code, please make it well documented. We all would like to know what it is doing without digging around
- If you would like to add another WPILib project, make sure to ask before hand. We don't want too many projects in here as this is more of an example repo
- Stick to Java and Python if possible but if you would like to use C++, make it well documented as our team uses Java primarily. (Would need to go in its own WPILib project)
- Add any examples you would like, can be related to the WPILib API or not. Any examples will help further the understanding of others

**General**
- Be cival and kind. Giving constructive critisim is okay but at least be kind about it
- If you have any questions or have an issue, feel free to start a discussion or open up an issue
- Look in the [TODO discussion](https://github.com/J-The-Fox/FRC-Team-5098/discussions/4) to see what else needs to be completed. If you wanna add something or change something, feel free to ask
